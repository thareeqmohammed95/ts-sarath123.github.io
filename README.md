## What is a Fablab?
<p>Fablab or fabrication lab is a small scale workshop equipped with computer controlled tools with the aim to make "ALMOST ANYTHING".
</p><br><br><br>
## Fab lab in MESCE
<br>
<p> There are around 22 fablabs in kerala. Fablab Kochi, Fablab Trivandrum and other 20 labs are in engineering colleges. Mes college of engineering is one among them. They have a well develepod fablab in which student and faculty development programs are taking place. Fablab in MESCE consists of the below mentioned machines.

<br> 3D printer is a machine allowing the creation of a physical object from a three-dimensional digital model, typically by laying down many thin layers of a material in succession.
<br><br>

## PCB Milling Machine

<br>
Printed circuit board milling (also: isolation milling) is the process of removing areas of copper from a sheet of printed circuit board material to recreate the pads, signal traces and structures according to patterns from a digital circuit board plan known as a layout file.
<br><br>

## Vinyl Cutting Machine
<br><br>

<br><br>A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).

## Day 1
<br> <br> <p>
 It is really proud to say that i was a member of the first student development program in the fablab. Our instructor Mr. Jaseel gave us a brief explanation of fablab and the scope of fablab. His words was so impressive that many of us including me thought of taking fablab as a carrier option. He also explained about the overall works to be done in this 2 week workshop. He introduced new websites to us and asked us to make our own websites.

 ## Day 2
 <br> <br>
 <p> Jaseel sir introduced us to the various equipments in the lab. Those equipments are mentioned above. Today we learned how to do documentation. After that the whole batch was grouped into 2 groups. That's all for the day. Stay tuned for more updates.
